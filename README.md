# Glint

A calculator with features I find useful.
```
natural operators
    x% of y     <=>     x / 100.0 * y

numbers with commas and underscores
    1,345,235   <=>     1345235

sym("string") gives symbol callouts
    sym("left arrow") == "←"

ruby-esque lack of mandatory parens
    f a         <=>     f(a)


big(x) - bignumber
```
