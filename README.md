A calculator with features I find useful.
```

numbers
    3.4
    .5
    
    "3." is NOT a number; even though there is no difference between 3 and 3.0, prefer "3.0" when you would feel tempted to use "3."


natural operators
    x% of y     <=>     x / 100.0 * y

numbers with commas and underscores
    1,345,235   <=>     1345235

sym("string") gives symbol callouts
    sym("left arrow") == "‚Üê"

ruby-esque lack of mandatory parens
    f a         <=>     f(a)


big(x) - bignumber

{ x y ; x + y }

or

$1 + $2 - automatic lambda with two parameters?

or

f(x; y) := expression

```
